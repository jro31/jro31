- 👋 Hi, I’m Jethro. I build things.
- 🛠 My favourite tools are Ruby on Rails and React/Next.js.
- 👀 Outside of coding (and sometimes because of it) I run.
- 👨🏼‍💻 I'm currently taking on new projects.
- 🙋‍♂️ To learn more, find me at [jethrowilliams.com](https://jethrowilliams.com/), or take a deeper look at some of my projects at [jethro.codes](https://jethro.codes/).
